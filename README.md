# Views (viewsdx.com) language support in Sublime

To install this package, copy the files `views.sublime-settings`, `views.sublime-syntax`, and
`views.tmTheme` to your user packages directory.
In Mac it seems to be `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` but it may be
different for you. You can open this directory from sublime though, by going to
`Preferences -> Browse Packages`.

We know that's far from ideal but none of us is a Sublime user and the docs for publishing the
package weren't easy enough to follow. We'd love to go through the official channels though, so
you're super welcome to submit a PR to fix this :). Thanks in advance!
